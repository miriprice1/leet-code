**Leet-coder project**

This project is a dummy project for the leet-code.com site, allowing users to solve questions and manage question entities by adding, editing, and deleting questions.

*Tasks to Complete:*

   **1. Improving Edit Question Option:** Currently, the selected question is presented to the user in the form of a JSON object, which is not ideal. 
   The goal is to display each field in a suitable input box to create a more user-friendly interface.

   **2. Enhancing Solution Feedback:** Provide feedback to the user in case of incorrect solutions or compilation errors. 
   Display details of the error and its location for better understanding.

   **3. Implement Logging Functionality:** Create a log file to record all user actions. 
   Develop a dedicated middleware to log every request sent to the server, along with all user actions.

   **4. User Management System:** Implement a user management system, including user registration, login functionality, 
   point accumulation for correct solutions, and tracking of questions solved by each user.

*Bugs to Fix:*

   **Array of Boolean Type in JS:** Currently, it is not possible to send an array of boolean type in JavaScript. This issue needs to be addressed promptly.

*Note:*

   To prevent unnecessary navigation and switching between folders, the runtime files are located in the external folder of the project. 
   The project's navigation (reading/creating files, etc.) has been adapted accordingly. 
   As a result, running the code only through the executable files is recommended to avoid issues with VSCode or other IDEs.

*Personal Note:*

   These past two weeks have been quite challenging for me as I've dedicated long hours to this project. 
   However, I've felt a significant sense of progress and learning throughout. 
   I've explored unfamiliar concepts, learned new programming languages, and delved into technologies I hadn't used before. 
   All of this has been an amazing experience that has highlighted the value of pushing boundaries and continuous learning. 
   Today, I realize how rewarding the journey has been. 
   Thank you, once again.
